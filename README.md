# There will be README

### Thanks to [fonsleenaars](https://github.com/fonsleenaars/) for information about Usher API and overall [info about HLS and VODs](https://github.com/fonsleenaars/twitch-hls-vods)

## Warning
APIs that used in **ttvldr** are mostly deprecated and can be closed in any moment. Keep it in mind when you will download any VODs from [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv).

## Usage

### I'm too lazy for README in the initial commit
